 - Perused Data Structures like Hashmaps and Arraylists for encompassing data.
 - Perused Object Oriented Principles like
   - Inheritance

   - Abstraction 
- 1200+ Lines of Source Code written by me in Java

## Running 
- Just download the source code and run it as follows on IntelliJ Platform. 
- This code can be run on Eclipse as well. 
- You will need Java14 environment for running this code.

## Bugs 
- In case the code is not running, you can copy paste the code on your Main.java file in your IntelliJ platform. Keep in mind the change the Public Class from Public Class amongus to Public Class Main if you wish to run it.  
- I faced a small issue while downloading it and running the code, I chose to copy paste and make the public class changes as previously mentioned. 

Have fun!!!
